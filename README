BEC OE-core build template

Build system based on oe-core, OpenEmbedded, and Angstrom

===========================================================
EXAMPLE of setting up a beagleboard build:

. envsetup.sh
oe_setup beagleboard
bitbake systemd-console-image

===========================================================
MOTIVATION

This build template is designed to be used for product
build systems (used to build product software), and thus
has the following goals:

1) simplicity: uses well understood things like bash and
   git submodules.
2) robustness: git submodules may be a pain, but they are
   a robust solution for production environments.

===========================================================
DOCUMENTATION

. envsetup.sh

This file will create a bunch of functions in the environment
prefixed with oe_ that can be executed.
