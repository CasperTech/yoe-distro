BEC OE-core build template

Build system based on oe-core, OpenEmbedded, and Angstrom.

===========================================================
EXAMPLE of setting up a beagleboard build:

. envsetup.sh
oe_setup beagleboard
bitbake systemd-image

===========================================================
MOTIVATION

This build template is designed to be used for product
build systems (used to build product software), and thus
has the following goals:

1) simplicity: uses well understood things like bash and
   git submodules.
2) robustness: git submodules may be a pain, but they are
   a robust solution for production environments, and 
   error handling is pretty good.

===========================================================
USING

In general, this build system must be run in a bash shell.
To set up the environment, source the following file:

. envsetup.sh

This file will create a bunch of functions in the environment
prefixed with oe_ that can be executed.  Type oe_ <tab><tab>
to see them.

Information on various files/directories:
  - build: temporary directory where build actually takes place
  - conf: configuration files for the build
  - sources: various sources used for the build.  Most entries
    in this directory are git submodules, but the downloads
    directory contains files that are downloaded by various
    recipes during builds.
  - scripts: utility scripts
  - localconfig.sh: file created by  envsetup.sh that contains
    directory specific variables based on the build system location.

To add a new layer:

  git submodule add <git URI> sources/meta-mylayer
  add layer to conf/bblayers.conf

conf/local.conf contains settings that are commonly modified such
as parallel build options.
